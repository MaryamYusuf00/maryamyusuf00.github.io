			<p>"When I first joined Maryam's CodeCamp, I didn't even know what python could be used for. But ever since I completed all the required courses on python programming, I've set onwards to work for Apple and Google. Without Maryam's CodeCamp this wouldn't have been possible, they changed my life!"<strong>-Adelina, 23.</strong></p>

			"My very first day at Maryam's CodeCamp felt very comforting. All the instructors made sure the entire class was flowing along with the lesson and really took their time to explain anything that wasn't clear to the students. I 100% recommend this fine institution."<strong>-Abduljaleel, 25.</strong>
